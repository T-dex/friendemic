You can add unique users and change their online status. I ran into a small issue of having the availability update and not push the current user into the User list, I could not figure it out how to get it updated a better way. I am sure that it can be done, with the time and knowledge. Also ran into issues with log out button and not clearing the backend DB. Left it in to continue to build off of and clean up the site a little better.

Wanted ideally to display time based on location automatically and was not able to find a solution that worked with the parameters I had set. Would like to have an API that connects to slack/zoom or any messaging platform as well for the future

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
